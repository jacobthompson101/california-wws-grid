"Excerpt from Excel files Readme Sheet."

"This file contains two sets of information: Production data and curtailments data.
This data is similar to the information provided in daily renewable and curtailments reports, respectively, but in five-minute intervals.
Given the five-minute granularity, there is potential for mismatches when compared to the hourly data provided in the daily reports.
These files contain raw data, and while the ISO has reviewed for accuracy, the data is provided as is, and is not considered operational or settlement quality data.

All  data is in megawatt (MW) units.

The production table provides supply and demand information.
For the demand, actual load and  net load (actual load less wind production less solar production) are provided.
For the supply, the production data is broken out by technology including:
-  solar and wind
-  renewable, which includes solar, wind, biomass, biogas, geothermal and small hydropower
-  thermal, which includes thermal production from different technologies  with the exception of nuclear and geothermal
-  large hydropower, which is not classified as renewable
-  imports  coming into the ISO area, which is the net actual interchange.
-  total production, which is the sum of all internal supply including  renewable, large hydro, nuclear and thermal.
The last column of Load less (generation and import) is to verify that supply matches demand.

The curtailment table provides solar and wind curtailments per interval; only  intervals in which a curtailment was observed are listed.

The amounts of curtailments are not counted  in the production quantities."
